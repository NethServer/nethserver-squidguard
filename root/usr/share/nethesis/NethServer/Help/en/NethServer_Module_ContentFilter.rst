==================
Web content filter
==================

The web content filter is used to control web browsing and
site blocking using some variables such as keywords, IP
address, internal users, or evaluating the content of the web page,
or file extensions. With this tool it is possible for example to enable
access only on some desired sites (such as those of company interest)
while blocking all others.

The content filter is based on profiles.
A profile is composed by three parts:

* Who: host or user is accessing the web
* What: a filter composed by multiple allowed or blocked categories
* When: a time frame within the access is filtered

There is also a special profile which applies to any client
at any time.
